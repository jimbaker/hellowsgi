HelloWSGI
=========

The HelloWSGI sample project demonstrates how to use [Fireside][] to
support running Python WSGI apps in a standard Java servlet
container. It uses the [Clamp][] project to produce a single jar for
inclusion in a war file. However, in the future it should be also
possible to support warless deployments with containers like Jetty.

Start by installing Jython 2.7.0. Get it at the
[Jython website][]. Make sure you use the standard install, which
includes running ensurepip.

Jython does not distribute the [servlet classes][] in the installed
version of Jython. So you will need to have a servlet API jar on your
`CLASSPATH` so that Clamp can properly build. A good one to use is the
one we use in Jython for building/testing: get [servlet API jar][].

Now that you have installed Jython 2.7.0, the pip command is now
available in `$JYTHON_HOME/bin`. You may want to alias
`$JYTHON_HOME/bin/pip` as `jpip`, or you can use [pyenv][] to manage
so that you can have a Python environment that is based on Jython,
instead of CPython.

Next install the HelloWSGI depdendencies. Clamp and Fireside are
essential, whereas you can use the WSGI-compliant tooling of your
choice; I have simply chosen [Bottle][] and [Mako][] as being
particularly simple. Using Jython's pip:

````bash
pip install bottle mako
pip install git+https://github.com/jythontools/clamp.git
pip install git+https://github.com/jythontools/fireside.git
````

Now you can build an über jar for HelloWSGI by running the install and
singlejar build steps:

````bash
$ jython setup.py install singlejar
````

This setup will result in `hellowsgi-0.1-single.jar`. (The version, such
as 0.1, comes from `setup.py`.) With the jar built, we put it in a war
file with the usual layout:

````
.
├── META-INF
│   └── MANIFEST.MF
└── WEB-INF
    ├── lib
    │   └── hellowsgi-0.1-single.jar
    └── web.xml
````

Configure `web.xml` for the war file something like this, adding other
servlets as desired, not to mention other configuration. The key piece
is the entry point for Fireside is specified by `wsgi.handler`; simply
point it to a Python callable - function, bound method - supporting
the WSGI standard:

````xml
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
      version="3.0">  
        
  <servlet>
   <servlet-name>fireside</servlet-name>
   <servlet-class>org.python.tools.fireside.servlet.WSGIServlet</servlet-class>
   <init-param>
     <param-name>wsgi.handler</param-name>
     <param-value>hellowsgi.simple_app</param-value>
   </init-param>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>fireside</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
</web-app>
````

It's pretty easy to do just that, especially with something like
Bottle. If you look at the HelloWSGI sample code, the
`hellowsgi.simple_app` entry point and corresponding code is defined
as follows:

````python
from bottle import Bottle, MakoTemplate, route

simple_app = app = Bottle()
hello_template = MakoTemplate('<b>Hello ${name}</b>!')
bye_template = MakoTemplate('<b>Bye ${name}</b>!')


@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def index(name):
    return hello_template.render(name=name)

@app.route('/bye/<name>')
def index(name):
    return bye_template.render(name=name)
````

Now that you have the pieces, pack up the war file by some means. This
next step assumes everything is in the warpack directory, with the
appropriate layout, and uses the jar command to construct the war
file:

````bash
$ jar cf hellowsgi.war -C warpack .
````

Next we will run a container to serve up this war file. I have found
[Jetty Runner][] to be the easiest way to serve a war file from the
command line:

````bash
$ java -jar jetty-runner.jar hellowsgi.war
````

You can then try out performance with Apache Benchmark:

````bash
$ ab -k -c 20 -n 50000 localhost:8080/hello/world
````

Here are the results I'm getting:

````
$ ab -k -c 20 -n 50000 localhost:8080/hello/world

Note that the first requests will see initialization of the Jython runtime; then the requests will see JIT warmup. You can see this in a subsequent run of the ab tool:

````
Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%      1
  66%      1
  75%      2
  80%      2
  90%      2
  95%      4
  98%      6
  99%      9
 100%    131 (longest request)
 ````

and then with a third run, the JIT really has started to see warmup:

````
Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%      1
  66%      2
  75%      2
  80%      2
  90%      2
  95%      3
  98%      3
  99%      4
 100%     11 (longest request)
````

At some future point you might see the effects of a GC (confirmed by looking at JConsole as well). Just using the defaults in Java 7 on OS X 10.10.2, it's still quite reasonable:

````
Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%      1
  66%      2
  75%      2
  80%      2
  90%      2
  95%      3
  98%      4
  99%      5
 100%    114 (longest request)
````

So there you go. HelloWSGI doesn't do very much, but it does
illustrate what it takes to link a standard Python WSGI app into
Jython in a very simple fashion.
